# Portfolio

##### This repo is created because I wanted to test if copying my existing _light_ portfolio created with NextJS to a vanilla JS would be a big improvement, and because I am learning vim motions.

## Guide

##### Tailwindcss cli that watches live changes:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./styles.css -o ./tailwind.css --watch
```
